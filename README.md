# Deep-Learning

This repository is providing a collection of Deep Learning models and implementations. Current projects
models include ANN and CNN for image classification as well as a CNN based Autoencoder and cGAN networks 
for image colorization on the CIFAR-10 images dataset. 

Upcoming project consist of RRN network architecture for spam detection.
